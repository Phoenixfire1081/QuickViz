About
#####

QuickViz is a python-based visualization and data analysis framework built with the `Mayavi <https://docs.enthought.com/mayavi/mayavi/>`_ engine. The UI is built with Enthought's `TraitsUI <https://docs.enthought.com/traitsui/>`_ framework. QuickViz as the name implies is intented for fast visualization of 3D time-series data, particularly those from numerical simulations and experimental datasets. 

On the visualization side, the following are currently supported:
.. - Isosurfaces
.. - Volume rendering
.. - 2D slice (filled contours, streamlines with line integral convolution, vector slice)
.. - 3D streamlines
